> Project for the Privacy Hackathon by **ZCash**
> by **Nestor Bonilla**

**Z Act** is a decentralized application to help coordinate marches and activism activities under an anonymity layer using geofence validation and zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) through Shielded Zcash transactions.

## Privacy Hackathon
> The Protecting Privacy Virtual Hackathon invites hackers to interact with and build on a wide range of privacy-focused projects to help users protect themselves, their data, and their money in the face of increasing surveillance by both state and corporate actors. For this project, I will publish the following deliverables:
